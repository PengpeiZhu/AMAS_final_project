## Description: 

#### This project aims to generate fake spectral emission line data consisting of 4 components, and fit the data with six different competing models, from simple to more complex models. We compute the fitting's AICc, BIC and DIC values, compare and discuss which information criteria are the best in different scenarios and why.

## Outline:

### 1. Data Generation (Jiazhe)

#### Generate 3 sets of data: 
##### 1. Base data with 4 Gaussian components, evenly separated (i.e., fix position), leave the amplitude and width of the Gaussian free. Also add Gaussian noise and uniform noise.
##### 2. Base data + more noise.
##### 3. Base data + replacing some of the Gaussian with Trapezoid distribution.

### 2. Model Fitting
